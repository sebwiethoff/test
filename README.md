# Continuous deployment

Definition: 
It’s a process whereby all code that is written for an application is immediately deployed into production. The result is a dramatic lowering of cycle time and freeing up of individual initiative. It has enabled companies I’ve worked with to deploy new code to production as often as fifty times every day.

continuous deployment requires tremendous discipline and can greatly enhance software quality, by applying a rigorous set of standards to every change to prevent regressions, outages, or harm to key business metrics.

By making a few simple investments and process changes, any development team can be on their way to continuous deployment. It’s the journey, not the destination, that counts. Here’s the why and how, in five steps

1. Continuous integration server:

This is the backbone of continuous deployment. We need a centralized place where all automated tests (unit tests, functional tests, integration tests, everything) can be run and monitored upon every commit.
At the beginning, do not be afraid. It is easy while following a simple rule: we’ll add a new automated test every time we fix a bug. Following that rule will start to immediately get testing where it’s needed most: in the parts of your code that have the most bugs and, therefore, drive the most waste for your developers.
